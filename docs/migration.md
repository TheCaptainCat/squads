# Upgrading a squad to a new squads version

Upgrading the `squads` package is usually free: install the new version and run `sq sync`. A
*migration* — rewriting on-disk content — is only needed when a release changes the **durable
on-disk format** (item frontmatter, sq markers, or the folder layout). When that happens, `sq` tells
you and `sq migrate` handles it.

Companion to [adoption.md](adoption.md) (importing a *foreign* project into squads). This doc is
about moving an *existing squad* from one squads version to the next.

## TL;DR

```bash
pip install -U squads                  # or: uvx squads@<new> …
git switch -c chore/upgrade-squads     # clean rollback point

sq migrate up                          # if the squad is behind: runs the schema runners, repair, restamp
sq migrate chlog v<old>..v<new>        # any manual (LLM-assisted) steps for that release range
sq sync                                # regenerate tool-owned files (.claude/, CLAUDE.md, skills)
sq check                               # validate: markers intact, parents/refs/stories consistent
git add -A && git diff --cached        # review, then commit
```

You don't need to track when a migration is due: on an out-of-date squad **`sq` stops every command
and tells you to run `sq migrate up`**. If the squad is current, `sq migrate up` is a no-op.

## The `sq migrate` command

| Command | Does |
|---------|------|
| `sq migrate up` | Runs every **automatic** migration whose target schema is newer than the squad's, in order; rebuilds the index; stamps the new `schema_version`. Then prints which (if any) leave **manual** steps. |
| `sq migrate help` | The **changelog index** — every shipped migration: release, schema bump, one-line summary, and whether it has manual steps. |
| `sq migrate chlog vFROM..vTO` | The **complete manual steps** for migrations shipped in `(vFROM, vTO]` (release versions, exclusive-low). This is the canonical place those runbooks live — not buried in prose. |

`sq migrate *` are the only commands exempt from the schema gate, so they always run even on an
out-of-date squad — read the steps *before* applying them.

## How versions are stamped

squads records **two** independent version numbers (in `.squads.toml` and `.squads.json`):

| Field | Meaning | Bumped when |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `squads_version` | Package version that last wrote the managed files. Informational. | Every `sq init` / `sq sync` / `sq repair` / `sq migrate up`. |
| `schema_version` | The **durable-format contract** (currently **`2`**, `_models/_schema.py`). | Only when the on-disk frontmatter / markers / layout change incompatibly. |

`squads_version` drives a **non-fatal** notice (`version_notice`): *"squads X detected … run `sq
sync`"* — about regenerating tool-owned files, not data. `schema_version` is the **hard gate**
(`require_current_schema`): if the squad's value differs from the build's `SCHEMA_VERSION` it stops
the command — behind → *"run `sq migrate up`"*, ahead → *"upgrade the squads package"*.

## The three tiers of on-disk state

Only the third tier can ever require a migration:

| Tier | Examples | How it updates | Migration? |
|------|----------|----------------|------------|
| **Tool-owned / managed** | `.claude/**`, `CLAUDE.md` section, `squads/agents/skills/sq-*.md` | `sq sync` regenerates from templates | **Never** — disposable, never hand-edited. |
| **The index** | `squads/.squads.json` | `sq repair` rebuilds it from frontmatter | **Never (for data)** — it's derived; an index-only change just needs a tolerant reader + `sq repair`. |
| **Durable item files** | `squads/<type>/PREFIX-NNNNNN-*.md` (frontmatter + sq markers + body) | hand/agent-authored = **source of truth** | **Only this tier** — and `sq migrate up` rewrites the `.md`; `repair` then rebuilds the JSON. |

### What counts as a breaking change

`Item.from_frontmatter` reads a **fixed set of known keys** plus the nested `extra:` map, which
defines compatibility:

- **Non-breaking (no migration):** adding metadata under `extra:` (round-trips through `repair`);
  dropping a key (falls back to a default); adding a key to `.squads.toml` (`extra="ignore"`).
- **Breaking (needs a runner + `schema_version` bump):** a new top-level required key (one
  `from_frontmatter` doesn't read is **silently dropped on `sq repair`**); renaming/retyping a known
  key; renaming a marker tag; changing a sub-entity block shape; changing the folder layout / ID format.

## Authoring a migration (for contributors)

When a release changes the durable format:

1. **Add a runner** `src/squads/_migrations/_vNtoM.py` exposing `migrate(paths) -> int` — per-file,
   **idempotent**, **marker-safe** (edit only via `_sections`), **utf-8-pinned**, and it must **not**
   write the index (`repair` rebuilds it). If the step needs judgement, put an LLM runbook in a
   module-level `MANUAL` string instead of (or alongside) the deterministic logic.
2. **Register it** — append a `Migration(...)` to `_migrations/_registry.py::MIGRATIONS` (carrying the
   release `version`, `from_schema`/`to_schema`, one-line `summary`, `run=…`, and `manual=…`), and
   **bump** `_models/_schema.py::SCHEMA_VERSION`.
3. **Prefer non-breaking** — if the new data can live under `extra:` or be defaulted by
   `from_frontmatter`, you avoid a runner entirely.
4. **Keep `from_frontmatter` tolerant** of the previous shape for one cycle, so `repair` reconstructs
   the index correctly from a not-yet-rewritten file.
5. **Document & test** — a `### Migration` note in `CHANGELOG.md`; tests that build an old-format file
   in a `tmp_path` squad, run the runner (assert new shape + intact body + idempotent), and assert the
   schema gate blocks until `sq migrate up`.

The `manual` string is the source of truth for the runbook — `sq migrate chlog` renders it. Runner
modules are **private**; never expose them as `python -m …`. `sq migrate` is the only entry point.

```python
# src/squads/_migrations/_registry.py
MIGRATIONS = [Migration("0.2.0", 1, 2, "…summary…", _v1_to_v2.migrate, manual=_v1_to_v2.MANUAL)]
# src/squads/_models/_schema.py
SCHEMA_VERSION = 2
```

## Status today

`schema_version` is **`2`**. The shipped step is **v1 → v2** (`_migrations/_v1_to_v2.py`), which
`sq migrate up` does **automatically**: folds `extra.ref_kinds` into inline `ID:kind` refs; upgrades
subtask/story headings (`[ ]`/`[x]` checkboxes, `(→ USn)` suffixes) into the sq-owned `:meta` regions
and builds the summary tables; and gives legacy reviews an empty findings container. It's *tolerant*
(`from_frontmatter` folds the old `ref_kinds`), so the rewrite-then-`repair` reconstructs the index
even from a pre-2 squad. (`store.load()` reads `.squads.json` as-is and does **not** fold — which is
why the gate routes you through `sq migrate up` instead of letting a half-read index drift.)

Its one **manual** step (run `sq migrate chlog v0.1.1..v0.2.0` for the full runbook): a pre-2 review's
free-form prose findings can't be parsed automatically. `up` lays down the empty findings container;
an agent then recreates each prose finding as `sq finding add … --severity …` and deletes the stale
prose.
