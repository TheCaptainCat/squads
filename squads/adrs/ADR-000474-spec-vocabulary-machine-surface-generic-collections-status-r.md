## Context

`squads` is a generic workflow engine. Its vocabulary — item types, statuses, and badge
collections — is spec data loaded from the active `WorkflowSpec` (ADR-214), not hardcoded names.
The badge model itself (a `collection` of `badge`s, bound to a type/kind by a `field` that may
relabel it) is settled by ADR-323; the semantic-status marker `StatusSpec.role` (currently only
`role="superseded"`, consumed by one `sq check` rule) is part of that spec. ADR-459 gave the first
machine-readable projection of this vocabulary — `sq workflow types --json`, a bare-array catalog
of the type vocabulary — and explicitly scoped the status/lifecycle catalog *out*, as a separate,
larger surface for a later decision. This ADR is that decision, extended to also cover the
collection vocabulary.

The engine layer is already generic. `Item.badge_value(code)` / `set_badge_value(code, value)`
reach any spec-declared field (bundled `priority`/`severity` are dedicated attributes, custom axes
live in `extra`); `WorkflowSpec.fields_for(type)` and `badges.resolve_collection` resolve a type's
actual axes from the spec; `WorkflowSpec.status_role(status)` already reads the semantic role. The
gap is at the **machine surface**, which still leaks the bundled default names instead of
reflecting the active spec:

- `sq tree --json` emits a literal `"priority": it.priority` per node and nothing else — no
  severity, no custom collection. A spec that renames priority, drops it, or adds `impact` is
  misrepresented.
- `sq list --json` / `sq show --json` are closer (custom axes ride in `extra`) but still split the
  *bundled* names (top-level `priority`/`severity`) from *custom* ones (buried in `extra`) — not a
  uniform, spec-driven view.
- No surface exposes a status's semantic `role`, so a client wanting to style "work in flight"
  distinctly is forced to key on the literal status string (`status == "InProgress"`) — which
  breaks the moment a spec renames or adds a working state.
- No surface exposes the collection **vocabulary** (code → label → emoji), so a client that wants
  to render the real badge (`🟠 High`) must hardcode the emoji set.

The principle (op-pierre, REV-448 F20): "squads is a generic workflow engine. All collections
should be surfaced. If only priority is, that means priority is hardcoded." F26 is the same lesson
on the status axis: style by a spec-declared semantic role, never by the literal status name.
These are two vocabularies (badge collections; status roles) but **one surface-projection
decision** — reflect the active spec generically, never the bundled names — so they are decided
together here.

One surface already does the collection half correctly and is the shape precedent: `sq graph
--json` (`GraphNode.to_dict`) emits a generic `badges` map keyed by field code — `{"priority":
"high"}`, or `{"impact": "high", "urgency": "low"}` for a custom axis — built by `_resolve_badges`
iterating `spec.fields_for(item.type)` and reading `item.badge_value(f.code)`, kept *alongside* the
legacy `priority` key. This ADR generalizes that shipped pattern.

Note the asymmetry with ADR-459's "don't repeat per-type facts on every node" principle: a type's
`order`/`prefix` are per-*type* facts and rightly live only in the catalog, never on each item; but
a badge **value** (`priority=high`) and a **status** are per-*item* facts and belong on the item.
So this ADR splits each vocabulary in two: per-item **values** on the item surfaces, and the
per-spec **vocabulary** (labels/emoji/role/terminal) in catalog surfaces.

Downstream consumers already exist as stories: FEAT-471 US7 (the collection surface, F20; blocks
F19's client badge hover) and US9 (the status-role surface, F26; blocks the client's green
"active" coloring). Both consume the surface this decision defines and are sequenced after it.

## Decision

### Part A — Collection vocabulary on the surface (F20)

**A1. Every item-bearing `--json` surface emits a generic `badges` map** of per-item values, keyed
by field code:

```json
"badges": { "priority": "high" }
```

built with the shipped `_resolve_badges` shape (iterate `spec.fields_for(item.type)`, include a
field only when `item.badge_value(code)` is non-null). Applies to:

- `sq tree --json` — each node gains `"badges"` (today: only `"priority"`).
- `sq list --json` — each row gains `"badges"`, unifying the bundled/`extra` split.
- `sq show --json` — the payload gains a top-level `"badges"`, and **each `subentities` entry**
  gains its own `"badges"` (a sub-entity carries fields too, e.g. severity on a finding — built
  from `spec.fields_for(kind)` + `sub.badge_value`).

Keyed by **field code**, not collection code: the field code is the frontmatter/CLI identity a
consumer already sees, and a field may rebind/relabel its collection.

**A2. Collection vocabulary reaches clients via a catalog, not glued onto items.** Item surfaces
emit **codes** (`high`), never rendered glyphs (`🟠 High`) — the code is the stable,
spec-authoritative value; emoji/label are presentation and belong in the vocabulary catalog once
per spec, not duplicated onto every item. New surface, mirroring `sq workflow types --json`:

`sq workflow collections --json` — a bare JSON array, one object per declared collection:

```json
[
  {
    "collection": "priority",
    "label": "Priority",
    "ordered": true,
    "default": null,
    "badges": [
      { "code": "urgent", "label": "Urgent", "emoji": "🔴" },
      { "code": "high",   "label": "High",   "emoji": "🟠" },
      { "code": "medium", "label": "Medium", "emoji": "🟡" },
      { "code": "low",    "label": "Low",    "emoji": "🟢" }
    ]
  }
]
```

A client joins the two: read `badges: {"priority": "high"}` off an item, resolve field code →
collection, look up `high` in that collection's vocabulary for glyph + label.

**A3. The field-code → collection binding is surfaced on the type catalog.** The item `badges` map
is keyed by *field* code; the collections catalog (A2) is keyed by *collection* code. For the
bundled axes these coincide (field `priority` → collection `priority`), but a relabeled or custom
field (field `impact` → collection `severity`) needs the binding to be spec-driven too. Each `sq
workflow types --json` row gains a `fields` array so a client resolves field → collection from the
type catalog, then collection → vocabulary from the collections catalog:

```json
{
  "type": "bug",
  "order": 40,
  "prefix": "BUG",
  "reserved": false,
  "fields": [
    { "code": "priority", "label": "Priority", "collection": "priority" },
    { "code": "severity", "label": "Severity", "collection": "severity" }
  ]
}
```

This is an **additive** extension to ADR-459's type catalog — a new key on each row, no removal or
rename — and is therefore explicitly permitted by ADR-459's own additive-only evolution clause. It
references ADR-459, it does not amend it. The `workflow_types.json` golden fixture and the
field-set-vs-model drift test are updated to include the new `fields` key.

### Part B — Status semantic-role on the surface (F26)

**B1. Spec vocabulary.** `default_workflow.toml` gains `role = "active"` on `[statuses.InProgress]`
(work-item working state) and `[statuses.Active]` (roster working state). Both are already
`terminal = false`; `role` and `terminal` are orthogonal fields (Superseded already carries both),
so this is purely additive and clashes with nothing. `StatusSpec.role` stays `str | None` (one
optional role per status).

**B2. Status vocabulary on the surface via a catalog** (the ADR-459 pattern applied to statuses —
the surface that ADR explicitly deferred). New surface:

`sq workflow statuses --json` — a bare JSON array, one object per declared status:

```json
[
  { "status": "InProgress", "terminal": false, "role": "active",      "badge": "🟡" },
  { "status": "Done",       "terminal": true,  "role": null,          "badge": "🟢" },
  { "status": "Superseded", "terminal": true,  "role": "superseded",  "badge": null }
]
```

Fields: `status` (name), `terminal` (bool), `role` (str|null), `badge` (emoji|null). A client joins
an item's `status` string to this catalog to read `role`/`terminal`/`badge`, then styles by
`role == "active"` generically — never by the literal status name (the F20 anti-pattern).

**B3. Catalog-only — no per-item role field.** The semantic role is exposed *only* via the status
catalog; item surfaces (tree/list/show) do **not** gain a per-item `role`/`is_active` field. The
client joins `status → role` through the catalog, exactly as the type catalog is joined by type
name. This deliberately does **not** propagate the tree surface's per-node `is_open` convenience to
the role axis — `is_open` stays the lone per-item derived-status exception by design (a
constantly-used boolean for the primary open/closed axis), and role is not given the same
treatment. Keeping role catalog-only avoids duplicating a per-status fact onto every item.

### Shared contract for both parts

- **A `sq workflow <catalog> --json` family.** `types` (ADR-459), `collections` (A2), and
  `statuses` (B2) are three sibling catalog surfaces: bare JSON arrays, one row per declared
  vocabulary entry, every row carrying a stable frozen key set. Each new surface gets the ADR-459
  treatment: a module-level frozen field-set constant, a JSON golden fixture, and a
  field-set-vs-model drift test, plus service + CLI-smoke coverage.
- **Additive superset — no break.** No existing key is renamed, removed, or deprecated. `sq
  tree`/`sq graph` keep `"priority"`; `sq list`/`sq show` keep top-level `priority`/`severity` and
  `extra`; the `badges` map is layered alongside them, exactly as `sq graph --json` already does.
  Adding `role="active"` changes no existing consumer (only `Superseded` set a role before). All of
  this is JSON output / spec-TOML data only: no frontmatter change, no `.squads.json` change, no
  schema-version bump, no migration.
- **Per-item values vs. per-spec vocabulary.** Values (badge codes, status names) live on the item
  surfaces; vocabulary (labels, emoji, ordered/default, role, terminal) lives in the catalogs, once
  per spec — never duplicated onto every item.

### Explicitly deferred

- **Widening `StatusSpec.role` from `str | None` to `list[str]`.** A status could legitimately carry
  more than one semantic role; deferring the multi-role model keeps this increment additive. Revisit
  as its own decision (a model/schema change) if and when a second co-resident role appears.
- **Deprecating the legacy bundled keys** (`priority` on tree/graph; top-level
  `priority`/`severity` on list/show). Kept indefinitely here; a future deprecation is its own call.

## Consequences

- REV-448 F20 (root) and the F26 status-role gap are fixed at the surface. F19 (client badge hover)
  becomes a straight render of the generic `badges` map plus a catalog vocabulary lookup; the
  client's green "active" coloring (F26) becomes a straight `role == "active"` check — no hardcoded
  names, no hardcoded emoji, on either axis.
- The client stays fully spec-driven: a spec that renames priority, adds `impact`, renames the
  working status, or adds a working state is faithfully represented with zero client changes.
- Purely additive: existing consumers are untouched; no schema bump, no migration.
- Item payloads grow by a small per-item map (and per-sub-entity on `show`); the two new catalog
  surfaces are read-only and derived entirely from the active spec.
- Three coherent catalog surfaces (`types`/`collections`/`statuses`) now project the whole spec
  vocabulary, each contract-frozen and drift-tested.

## Alternatives considered

- **Emit rendered glyphs (`"🟠 high"`) on items.** Rejected: bakes presentation into the machine
  contract, couples every consumer to the emoji set, and duplicates the vocabulary on every item
  instead of once in a catalog.
- **Emit `status_role` (and label/emoji) per item on every surface instead of a status catalog.**
  Rejected (decision B3): the same per-item duplication — `role`/`terminal`/`badge` are per-status
  facts, derivable from the item's `status` via the catalog. The tree surface's existing per-node
  `is_open` stays the lone deliberate exception; the role axis is not given the same per-item
  convenience.
- **Rename/replace `priority` with `badges`, or the bundled split, as a breaking change.** Rejected:
  the additive superset costs nothing and matches the shipped `sq graph --json` precedent; the
  bundled/custom split *is* the F20 hardcoding, and a uniform generic map is the whole point.
- **Amend ADR-459 to add the status/collection catalogs.** Rejected: ADR-459 deliberately scoped the
  status/lifecycle catalog out as a separate surface; these are a new, referencing decision, not an
  edit to an accepted one.
- **Widen `StatusSpec.role` to a list now.** Deferred (above) — out of scope for this additive
  increment.
- **Key the item `badges` map by collection code, or ship a dedicated fields surface.** Rejected in
  favour of A3: the field code is the frontmatter/CLI identity a consumer already sees, and folding
  the binding into the existing type catalog reuses the ADR-459 surface rather than adding a fourth.

## Discussion

<!-- sq:discussion -->
- [2026-07-18T19:57:45Z] Robert Architect:
  - Addresses REV-448 F20 (generic collections surface, root of F19) and F26 (status_role + role=active). F19 is the client consumer that motivates the collection half; it renders whatever this surface emits. Consuming stories: FEAT-471 US7 (F20) and US9 (F26).
  - Folded F20+F26 into one ADR: same principle (project the spec vocabulary generically, never the bundled names) and one sq workflow <catalog> --json family (types [ADR-459] + collections + statuses). Does NOT amend ADR-459 — it delivers the status/lifecycle catalog ADR-459 deliberately deferred. Split into two later if the status half (which carries the role=active spec-data change + the deferred multi-role widening) warrants its own record.
  - Open questions before implementation (in the body): (1) how the field-code->collection binding is surfaced for relabeled/custom fields — recommend extending sq workflow types --json rows with each type's fields[]; (2) catalog-only status role vs. also a per-item convenience field; (3) one ADR vs two. Deferred (do not design in): widening StatusSpec.role str|None -> list[str].
- [2026-07-18T20:02:16Z] Pierre Chat:
  - Rulings on the three open questions (op-pierre): (1) Field→collection binding — yes, extend sq workflow types --json rows with fields: [{code, label, collection}]. Additive per ADR-459's additive-only clause. (2) Status role — Option A, catalog-only: no per-item role/is_active field; the client joins status→role via the statuses catalog (same as the type-catalog pattern). Do not propagate is_open's per-node convenience. (3) One ADR — keep it consolidated as drafted, do not split.
- [2026-07-18T20:06:07Z] Pierre Chat:
  - Accepted after reading the finalized body. Rulings baked in correctly; one consolidated ADR, references (does not amend) ADR-459/323/214. Proceed to implementation via FEAT-471.
