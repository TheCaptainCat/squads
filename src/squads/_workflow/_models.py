"""WorkflowSpec pydantic v2 value objects.

The loaded spec is the sole vocabulary authority for both axes: TOML type keys AND status
keys stay plain ``str`` (no enum coercion, no closed set). The reserved surface is exactly
the three roster types (``ROSTER_TYPES``) plus their agent-lifecycle statuses
(``_RESERVED_FLOOR`` — ``Draft``/``Active``/``Archived``); every other type or status is
ordinary spec vocabulary a project may drop, rename, or reorder.

The capability flags declared here (``category``, ``subentity_kind``, ``parent_required``,
``ref_rules``) are additive; ``SubentityKindSpec.completion`` is consumed by the sub-entity/
finding done-toggle (``_services/_subentities.py``). ``StatusSpec.role`` is the sole explicit
status axis — a reference into the ``RoleSpec`` catalog (``WorkflowSpec.roles``) that carries
``settled``/``hidden``/``color``; ``is_open``/``terminal_set``/``hidden_by_default`` are all
derived from the referenced role, never stored directly. They are encoded in
``default_workflow.toml``.

``Badge``/``Collection``/``Field`` are the badge-vocabulary schema: ``ItemSpec.fields`` /
``SubentityKindSpec.fields`` bind a type or sub-entity kind to a reusable ``Collection`` of
``Badge``s — "does type/kind X carry field Y" is a ``fields_for(X)`` lookup, replacing the old
closed-set ``Priority``/``Severity`` enums.
